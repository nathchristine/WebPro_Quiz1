            <h3>JAKARTA</h3>
            <!-- <p>Jakarta, officially the Special Capital Region of Jakarta and formerly known as Batavia until 1949, is the capital and largest city of Indonesia. Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in Southeast Asia and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN. The Special Capital Region has a status equivalent to that of a province and is bordered by two other provinces: West Java to the south and east; and (since 2000, when it was separated from West Java) Banten to the west. Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west. Jakarta's metropolitan area is ASEAN's second largest economy after Singapore.</p> -->
            <p>Jakarta is a huge, sprawling metropolis, home to over 10 million people with diverse ethnic group backgrounds from all over Indonesia. During the day, the number increases with commuters making their way to work in the city and flock out again in the evenings. This city is divided into 5 districts, namely Jakarta Pusat, Jakarta Utara, Jakarta Barat, Jakarta Timur, and Jakarta Selatan. The term ‘Jabodetabek’ refers to Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-Bekasi - the Greater Jakarta area consists of megacities surrounding the capital.</p>
